# 🌍 Planet Orbitron

> *A sophisticated planet implementation*

## 🚀 Overview

Orbitron is our custom implementation of the `PlanetAI` trait, designed to intelligently manage a Type B planet. This planet operates as an autonomous agent, coordinating with explorers and orchestrators to optimize resource generation, combination, and rocket deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture

<details>

<details>
<summary>Core Decision-Making Logic</summary>

The `OrbitronAI` struct implements the core decision-making logic for our planet. Located in `ai/orbitron.rs`, it processes incoming messages and makes strategic decisions about:

- **Resource Generation**: When and which basic resources to produce
- **Resource Combination**: Creating complex resources from basic ones
- **Rocket Management**: Launching rockets with optimal resource payloads
- **Explorer Interaction**: Responding to explorer requests and coordinating transfers
